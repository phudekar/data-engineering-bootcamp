Thanks for the submission. You covered all 8 prompts, and your SQL is generally clear and well-commented. I’ve reviewed each focus area with a lens on correctness, readability, and best practices. Below is detailed feedback by prompt, with specific strengths and fixes.

1) De-duplication Query (nba_game_details)
- What’s good:
  - Correct use of ROW_NUMBER() partitioned by (game_id, team_id, player_id).
  - Sensible ordering: rows with non-null minutes first, then higher minutes, then higher plus_minus.
- Issues to fix:
  - Parsing minutes: min is TEXT and can contain values like 'DNP', '', or NULL. split_part(... )::int will error if the format isn’t dd:dd.
  - NULLIF(..., NULL) always returns the first argument; it’s a no-op here.
  - Consider a deterministic tie-breaker as a last ORDER BY to avoid non-determinism when values are equal (e.g., ORDER BY player_id).
- Suggested fix:
  - Safely parse minutes only when they match a time pattern and fallback otherwise.
  - Remove NULLIF wrapper.

  Example ordering expression:
  ORDER BY
    (gd.min ~ '^\d+:\d{2}$')::int DESC,
    CASE WHEN gd.min ~ '^\d+:\d{2}$'
         THEN make_interval(
                mins => split_part(gd.min, ':', 1)::int,
                secs => split_part(gd.min, ':', 2)::int
              )
         ELSE interval '0 seconds'
    END DESC,
    COALESCE(gd.plus_minus, -99999) DESC,
    gd.player_id

2) User Devices Activity Datelist DDL
- What’s good:
  - Row-per-(user_id, browser_type) model is acceptable per instructions.
  - device_activity_datelist as DATE[] with a default empty array is good.
  - Primary key on (user_id, browser_type) is appropriate.
- Issues to fix:
  - You commented “Use BIGINT for user_id” but created it as NUMERIC. Prefer bigint for IDs unless truly needed as arbitrary precision.
- Suggested change:
  - Use BIGINT for user_id (and consider the same for device_id in source tables if applicable).

3) User Devices Activity Datelist Implementation
- What’s good:
  - Correct join to devices to bring in browser_type.
  - Upsert logic merges arrays with DISTINCT and ordered aggregation—nice.
- Issues to fix:
  - If devices.browser_type can be NULL, this will violate the NOT NULL constraint. Add a COALESCE or filter out NULLs explicitly.
  - event_time is TEXT in your commented DDL. Casting is fine but consider normalizing the source to TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ to avoid repeated casts and timezone ambiguity.
- Suggested change:
  SELECT
    COALESCE(e.user_id, 0) AS user_id,
    COALESCE(d.browser_type, 'unknown') AS browser_type,
    ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT DATE(e.event_time::timestamp)) AS device_activity_datelist
  ...
  WHERE e.event_time IS NOT NULL

4) User Devices Activity Int Datelist
- What’s good:
  - Good attempt at exploding and computing bitmasks with day_idx = extract(day) - 1.
- Critical issues:
  - Missing month dimension. The bitmask must be computed per month; otherwise, day 1 across all months sets the same bit and conflates multiple months.
  - You created a single datelist_int per (user_id, browser_type). This can only represent one month’s worth of days. It must be keyed by (user_id, browser_type, month_start) or implemented in a separate monthly table.
- Suggested design options:
  Option A: Evolve user_devices_cumulated to be monthly
  - Add month_start DATE to the PK and store per-month dates and datelist_int.

  ALTER TABLE public.user_devices_cumulated
  ADD COLUMN month_start DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT date_trunc('month', now())::date;
  -- Then update PK to (user_id, browser_type, month_start) and populate month_start in loads.

  Option B: Create a derived monthly table
  - Keep user_devices_cumulated as-is for a global list of dates, and build a new table user_devices_monthly with:
    (user_id BIGINT, browser_type TEXT, month_start DATE, dates_active DATE[], datelist_int INT, PRIMARY KEY (user_id, browser_type, month_start))
  - Populate monthly by intersecting dates_active with each month and computing the bitmask.

  Core pattern for bitmask:
  WITH exploded AS (
    SELECT
      u.user_id,
      u.browser_type,
      date_trunc('month', d)::date AS month_start,
      (extract(day FROM d)::int - 1) AS day_idx
    FROM public.user_devices_cumulated u
    CROSS JOIN LATERAL unnest(u.device_activity_datelist) AS t(d)
  )
  , bits AS (
    SELECT
      user_id,
      browser_type,
      month_start,
      SUM((1::int) << day_idx) AS datelist_int
    FROM exploded
    GROUP BY 1,2,3
  )
  -- INSERT/UPSERT into the monthly table keyed by (user_id, browser_type, month_start)

5) Host Activity Datelist DDL
- What’s good:
  - Schema is correct: host TEXT PK and DATE[] with default empty array.
- Issues to consider:
  - Same as devices: if host can be NULL in source, either set NOT NULL upstream or COALESCE in your load.

6) Host Activity Datelist Implementation
- What’s good:
  - Correct DISTINCT date aggregation and ordered dedup in the upsert.
  - This is a valid incremental pattern for appending new days.
- Minor suggestions:
  - Filter out NULL event_time and NULL host or COALESCE host to avoid violating NOT NULL constraint and to reduce casts.

7) Reduced Host Fact Array DDL
- What’s good:
  - month DATE + host TEXT + hit_array INT[] + unique_visitors INT[] with PK (month, host) matches the spec.
  - Arrays as day-ordered sequences across the calendar of the month is right.

8) Reduced Host Fact Array Implementation
- What’s good:
  - Proper month_host seed, complete day calendar via generate_series, left join to daily, and array_agg ordered by day.
  - Upsert strategy is solid; recomputing full months is fine for homework.
- Suggestions:
  - For very large datasets, consider limiting to months impacted by new data (e.g., current open month or since max(month) in target).
  - COUNT(DISTINCT e.user_id) will ignore NULLs, which is typically desired; if you want to treat unknown visitors as a segment, COALESCE before counting.

General style and best practices
- Comments: You added helpful comments; nice job. You can prune commented-out DDL for source tables in final deliverables to reduce noise, or clearly separate “reference DDL” from “solution DDL”.
- Types: Prefer BIGINT for IDs, TIMESTAMPTZ for event times when possible.
- Determinism: Add final tiebreakers to ORDER BY in window functions.
- Safety: Always guard casts from TEXT to timestamp/int with WHERE filters or CASE expressions.

If something in my setup is off
- Please confirm your target warehouse (e.g., Postgres vs. Snowflake/BigQuery). Your SQL uses Postgres-specific features (arrays, generate_series, make_interval). If you’re on another platform, I can help translate.
- Share whether source columns like event_time are actually TEXT or TIMESTAMP/TIMESTAMPTZ in your environment.
- Clarify whether devices.browser_type and events.host can be NULL in real data.
- Confirm whether the expectation for datelist_int is explicitly “per month.” If yes, choose Option A (monthly cumulated table) or Option B (derived monthly fact) and I’ll help you refactor the minimal set of statements.

Summary
- Strong coverage of all 8 prompts with good array handling and upsert patterns.
- Biggest blocker to full correctness: datelist_int must be computed per month and keyed accordingly. Also tighten parsing for basketball minutes and null handling in your upserts.
- With the monthly fix for datelist_int and safer minutes parsing, this would be an A-level submission.
